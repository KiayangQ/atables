[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The goal of atables is to output tables from global environment to a .docx file efficiently.


## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KiayangQ/atables@main")
```


## Usage

Click "Addins" in Rstudio, find and click "output tables".

## Note

You can only use the addin when objects are detected at global environment, otherwise an error message will pop up.
